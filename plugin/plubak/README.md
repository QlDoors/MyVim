# CurrentWord.vim

A tiny plugin to show the other occurrences of the current word in the same
buffer, by underlining them when in Normal mode. In other modes, the underlines
disappear.

## Installation

Just put it in `~/.vim/bundle`, or wherever it is that Vundle puts things.

You probably also want to change the `CurrentWord` highlight, if you're not
using a colour scheme with a black/dark grey background.
